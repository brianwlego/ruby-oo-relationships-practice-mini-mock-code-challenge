Overall Assessment: 3/5

Additional Comments: 

I can see that you have a good understanding of associations. Be careful with your relationship methods. Your `book.author` method should be updated to `book.authors` because a book now has many authors. Additionally, it's incomplete. I know you know the correct way to write this method because you did it correctly for the `Author` class. So just be very careful and test your code thoroughly.
